## Currency-Converter

# This project gives you the equivalent of any amount of money in any currency you want.

   Money doesn't have a single universal format today. Almost every country has its own currency, resulting in hundreds of different monetary units worldwide. Understanding how these currencies relate to each other is crucial for international business, shopping, or travel. For this reason, currency conversion applications play an essential role in our lives.

This simple currency converter application provides an easy-to-use interface with input and output sections to facilitate quick conversions.
